## Description

The objective was to create a project that allowed a user to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. This project allows a user to do just that. They can use it directly in the browser or install it to their local computer.

## Installation

If the user wishes to install the application to their computer, they can just click the "Install" button at the top left of the screen. It will then prompt the user to click a button to install, based on their browser specifications.

## Usage

The user can use this application however they so choose, but with the design of the text editor, it is definitely something that's more for basic note taking. The user should know that there aren't text editing capabilities so it mirrors that of a notepad type application.
